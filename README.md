Hello world tutorial repository

Finishing the README, this is for tutorial purposes, and I don't expect to be editing this particular repository much after today.
Figured out there was a little more needed before finishing the tutorial, so here we go.
My name is Josh, I like video games and music (usually cinematic/soudtrack kind of stuff).
I find coding interesting in that I can go from nothing but a bunch of tools in front of me to a full-on game.
It's really fun to see something like it come all together.
